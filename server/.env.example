# This file provides an example of variables that should be in your .env file.
# These are typically secrets, API keys, or other values not suitable for the committed config.env file.
# IMPORTANT: .env variables will NOT override any variables that are already set by config.env or the system environment.
# Use .env to ADD variables that config.env does not provide (e.g., secret keys).

# Example for JWT (JSON Web Token) secret - this would NOT be in config.env
# JWT_SECRET=yourSuperSecretKeyForJWT

# Example for an external API Key - this would NOT be in config.env
# SOME_SERVICE_API_KEY=yourExternalApiKeyForSomeService

# Note: Variables like PORT, default MONGO_URI, NODE_ENV are typically in config.env
# and should not be duplicated here unless they serve a completely different purpose
# and have a different variable name.
